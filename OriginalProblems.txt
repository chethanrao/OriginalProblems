1) A median of a binary tree is defined as the average of elements at [depth/2,breadth/2-1],[depth/2,breadth/2+1] 
if depth of tree is odd 
and
average of the elements at [depth/2-1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2+1,breadth/2-1],[depth/2-1,breadth/2+1] and [depth/2+1,breadth/2+1]
if depth of tree is even.
Given a complete binary tree...find the median?

2) Shortest distance to a rotating target: A car is parked at one corner(left bottom) 
of a matrix and a passenger is at another corner diagnolly opposite(right top) the matrix. 
A car can move up or right .  
The passenger rotates  around a square with side x.

For every move of the car left or up....the passenger moves one block.
Find the shortest time of the car to the passenger?

3) Given a binary tree find sum of all the nodes in the sub tree of a target node.
Given that all values of nodes are unique and there exists a target node with value target node.
int binaryTree(TreeNode node,int targetNode)

4)
Given a binary tree find if sum of any subtree is equal to a given target sum.
If such a sub tree exists return the root of the subtree.
TreeNode binaryTree(TreeNode node,int targetSum)

5) Given a set of rectangles with (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4)
and a range (x5,x6) and (x7,x8) inclusive of the rectangles.
return all the missing vertices of a rectangles in the range (x5,x6) and (x7,x8).

6) If one draws a straight line through points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) and cuts a balanced binary tree. 
   Find the number of nodes in each cut part?
Here node at position (x,y) is at height x from top and at position y from left most node of the tree at that height.
All the adjacent nodes are of equal distance from each other.

7) Traverse a tree in  the below order and print all the elements in the tree

       4
    3    7
  2   6    9
1   5   8    10

8) find the number of islands in a tree which has 1s and 0s

9) Given a n x m grid and a String of 4 characters. 
Find the number of occurrences of the 4 characters in a square 
with each vertex a character of a string clockwise or anti clockwise ?


Example input:
1)n x m grid:
  a  b  t  e
  c  q  r  m
  s  n  p  o
  g  t  k  z

  bnoe


  b , n , o , e occurs once in the grid at position [0,1]  [2,1]  [2,3]  [0,3] in anti-clockwise manner.

10)
In a frictionless billiards board having co-ordinates (0,0),(0,x),(x,0),(x,x) when a ball starts from position  (0,y) and strikes (y,0)...find the co-ordinates of the line at nth impact on the boundaries of the board.(Given the angle of incidence equal to angle of reflection.)

11)
In a matrix where each number represents height of the block at that square. find the maximum amount of water that can be trapped in between the matrix?

12) 
Cut a circular linked list into two single linkedlist such that both singly linked list have same sum.

13) given a list of nodes remove nodes in that order and find the final number of unconnected trees that are obtained.
follow up: find the number of unconnected trees at each step
